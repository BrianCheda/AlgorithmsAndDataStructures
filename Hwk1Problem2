#Formal Description
#Program starts with six empty lists[A,Ab,B,Bb,C,Cb]. Ab and Bb are then populated by a user defined n-number of integers.
#We then iterate over Ab and Bb and change their values to binary using bin(). Since python cannot keep lists of bytes, we then
#proceed to turn the bytes into a string and store them in A and B respectively. C is then populated using A and B and the int
#function which convers the string stored variables to integers and then bytes. 1 bit is then added to the sum of A and B.
# the functions continues adding 1 bit to the summation of the indexes until all the values have been accounted for.
# The program then outputs A,B,C in binary format and then in decimal format using Ab,Bb and Cb

output = ('0'+ str(n+1)+'b') #creates the format so C array will always be n+1

print("The value of array A is:") #header for A array
print("["+', '.join(A)+"]") #strips the format of A array for consistent output before it was ['0','1','1'] now it's [0,1,1]
print("The value of array B is:") # header for B array
print("["+', '.join(B)+"]") #strips the format of B array for consistent output before it was ['1','0','1'] now it's [1,0,1]
print("The value of array C is:") # header for C array
print(C) # outputs the C array
#Formal Description
#The program takes in an input n to define the size of A and B arrays. The Arrays are then populated with randomly with bits.
#The value of the arrays are then condensed into strings a and b which are then turned into integers and added into c.
#The program then creates the format for C array so that even if A&B both equal 000 the output will still be 0000.
#At line 56 the program then takes the added integers, the format of our array and splits the bits accordingly.
#Each array is then printed. Lines 58 and 60 have extensive print codes to make the output more visually appealing and uniform.
